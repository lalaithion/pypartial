# pypartial

I created this library when I was annoyed with the limitations on partial application of functions in base python.  This library allows you to partially apply a function in any way, from creating copies of functions with different default arguments, to fixing arbitrary positional arguments.

This library is built using python 3, and will not work with python 2.
